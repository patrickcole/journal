  - Glad I could get another fetch example to play with. I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the fetch call as well as promises. It was a nice find to use jsonplaceholder.typicode.com as a way to get/post.

## Code Practices

- Fetch example was good review and example on implementation of the fetch API. One takeaway from this practice was that loading local files still requires a server to load (understandably so.)
- Destructuring practice reenforced my experiences with how to use destructuring both objects and arrays for quick access to properties needed/used.

## Additional Notes

Today I decided, since it's getting close to the end of the month, that I should reorganize the journal entries so that they are properly displayed by year, month and day. I believe this will keep the repository clean and easy to locate content. This new process does require more steps up-front, but I think it will help for later.
