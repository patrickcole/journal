- [Browsers — which one you must use?](https://codeburst.io/browsers-which-one-you-must-use-e009830ea3ae)
  - Very nice overall view of browsers in today's world. However, I believe the author doesn't accurately represent Microsoft's browsers (IE and Edge) correctly. Yes it's true that their usage numbers are much lower than say Chrome or Firefox. However, there's a large number of users that will be making the switch to Edge soon as support continues to run out on older machines and operating systems. Edge is the future for Microsoft's browser development and to ignore it completely goes against the intention of the article.
- [Having a Good Relationship with CSS](https://dev.to/sarah_chima/having-a-good-relationship-with-css-f1e)
  - Great testimonial to the power of CSS. Good examples of how to improve overall experience using CSS. Nice anecdotes on the author's life with CSS. Bookmark worthy to come back and check on how I'm doing against the rules/suggestions from this article.
- [More Collaborative Pull Requests](https://dev.to/vorahsa/more-collaborative-pull-requests-43ng)
  - I don't have a lot of experience on pull-requests and the communication aspects of them, yet. What intrigued me about this article was the author's experiences. It sounded like experiences can have a wide range from very good to very bad and it's important to really tune in on what your organization does in practice and flow.
- [My anti-procrastination list](https://dev.to/edneypitta/my-anti-procrastination-list-572h)
  - Great points here for keeping organized and going throughout the day. The main thing is to have a plan to keep the short memory optimized and not overloaded!
- [On Meetings and Wasting Time](https://dev.to/henrypoydar/on-meetings-and-wasting-time-37g4)
  - Scheduling meetings in the morning or later in the afternoon can definitely help with keeping developers focused throughtout the day. Love the example video the author used from the film "Apollo 13" for showing results of good collaboration.
- [Don't Put Personal Information in Code!](https://dev.to/jdsteinhauser/dont-put-personal-information-in-code-3566)
  - The hero image says it all (points at picture of Homer Simpson exlaiming "DOH!")

- [Sal Khan - Let's teach for mastery - not test scores](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores)
  - The leveling up mastery scale is soo important here. Moving on to the next level shouldn't be fixed to a time scale for someone. It should be as long as they need to master it. Wonderful talk here and good to remember when learning anything.
