- [How to build a responsive navbar using CSS Flexbox and Javascript](https://itnext.io/how-to-build-a-responsive-navbar-using-flexbox-and-javascript-eb0af24f19bf)
  - Built this tutorial in `code/2018-06-20` folder. The example code was good, but I could see some areas to improve the use of CSS classes. Additionally, I decided to implement the classes using the BEM pattern. Overall, very happy with my refactoring as I was also able to implement the menu toggle in a more accessible way with the use of a `<button>` element.
- [That data looks so fetching on you: Understanding the JS Fetch API](https://itnext.io/that-data-looks-so-fetching-on-you-understanding-the-js-fetch-api-880eae0c8d25)
  - Another code practice for me as I knew of fetch and promises, but not really used it yet. From this example, I can see how much better it is to use than XMLHttpRequest (AJAX). Through testing the code, I found a nice source to test POST requests with fetch, [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/). Something that I noted for future discussion/learning is how I can console.group various async requests so that they do not overlap each other. I tried at first to add console.group before each fetch request, but the second would always be inside the first, as the first task was not complete. A possible solution to this might be async/await, but I haven't looked into this yet.
