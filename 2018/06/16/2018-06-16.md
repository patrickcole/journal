  - Compress your images and serve them at correct size
  - Minify and compress all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Limit the use of heavy JavaScript. Render as much as you can on the server and use JavaScript to sprinkle on enhancements
  - Optimise for the critical path so that your content appears as quickly as possible
  - Start familarising yourself with HTTP/2 because that changes so many things
  - If you're going to use something like Bootstrap, be sure you remove all the unused CSS in a build process. There's a ton of unnecessary bloat.
  [7 common mistakes made with responsive mockups](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/common-mistakes-responsive-mockups-111517922)
    - Multiple [device] screen sizes is a fact that we cannot ignore as designers/developers.
    - Mindset needs to be shifted from fixed screen sizes to devices (small, medium, large, xl)
    - Article suggests these options:
      - Micro-screens
      - Small screens
      - Mid-range
      - Large
      - Extra-large
    - Devices are released almost daily. To try to peg a design to a specific device will only be obsolete when a new one comes out that is slightly different.
    - "Build to the design, not the device"
    - Start with mobile-first approach.
    - If it scales up from a small device, you have something going well. The content is king after all.
    - Add media query breakpoints when the design begins to look odd or needs some adjustments.
    - Use responsive breakpoints (rem media queries!)
    - Remember to think about touch controls (not every user will be using mouse to hover, click, etc.)
    - Touch targets should not be difficult to reach with one hand or too small to select with fingers.
    - Implement native scrolling. Do not overthink what is already present.
    - Keep the experience nice from your site to another. For example, link to a mobile version, if it exists for small screen users instead of desktop.
    - Don't waste space by simply extending a mobile first layout to desktop. Allow the larger amount of space to have more desktop-friendly graphics. Extend the line spacing lengths out so that content feels more natural on desktop.
    - Use consistent navigation. Don't simply have a desktop version and a mobile version (ie hamburger!) Simply using a shortened desktop navigation with the phrase "Menu" is much better than trying to come up with an alternate design.
    - Adjust controls (buttons) to the available screen space.
    - Prioritize content and do NOT hide content based on a device's screen size. Users may be frustrated that the same content is not available from desktop to mobile.
