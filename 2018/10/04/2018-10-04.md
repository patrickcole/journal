## Code Practice

### babel-node-example

Today's code practice utilized a simple article on how to setup a Babel 7 environment with Node.js. This article was very helpful as it outlined the required dependecies and explained the steps to get going with building and transpiling code for compatability.

I can see this code practice being useful as a starter project for future Babel-related development in the future. I felt like this was a quick and easy way to explain how Babel 7 works and did not add a lot of extra code to confuse users.

### css-scroll-snap

The new CSS Scroll Snap specification is a welcome new addition when designing and implementing interfaces on the web. Much of the functionality that has been provided was previously created in JavaScript plugins. Not having to utilize JavaScript now, frees up resources and gives web pages more performance while still delivering those controls that were previously only available through scripts.

Overall, the CSS Scroll Snap seems easy to implement once the control has been designed and configured to "snap" at their respective positions. The only limitation as of this writing is the browser implementations of the specification as it is still lacking from all modern browsers.
