## Code Practice

For today's code practice, I decided to take one of the articles I tagged for a practice. The article, "Building a Simple URL Shortener With Just HTML and Javascript", gave me a good starting point for practice. Throughout the article, I felt some improvements could be made to make the code more reliant on newer built-in APIs as opposed to external libraries such as jQuery. I get the author's message of trying to establish a system with the code they have selected, but I couldn't go back to using jQuery just for this system.

I instead felt it was important to start using the Fetch API as well as Promises. Both of these concepts are still new to me and I felt I needed to expand on these. As is indicated in my code practice, I rely on promises throughout the entire script as the fetch calls are completely async. In some cases, I needed to setup one promise that relies on another's decision. I'm aware that async/await makes some of what I'm doing here better, but I'm not sure I'm ready to cross that bridge yet.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the end result of this practice. I was able to build a form that accepts a URL (although not validated yet) string and saves it to jsonstore.io. It checks if the short url hash has already been used and if the short url is in the url hash, it will display the long url already inside the form.

This practice is by no means a completed product. I understand there are lots of areas that can be improved from where it is on this submission. However, I'm satisfied that I was able to work through the issues I had and only spent a few hours building this up.
