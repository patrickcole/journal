## Code Practice

Today, I was reading the article, "How to build a floating label input field" and I had a thought about how the author implemented their examples. I was curious if there was a way to implement the focus change without resorting to JavaScript. I know that with checkbox and radio inputs, focus/selection can be achieved without the use of JS, but I wanted to know more about basic labels with input fields.

What I realized was that in order to properly change focus upon selection/focus for an input's label, it would have to appear behind the input field in the markup. To me, this is not useful from an accessibility standpoint (I revise my position later on.) I need to maintain the order of label + input so that any reader will first read the label and then provide an option for value entry.

Since CSS does not have a previous sibling selector, adding focused state styles to the label proved to be difficult. Through research, I found that part of the CSS Selectors Level 4 draft, includes the `:focus-within` pseudo class. This pseudo class provides the ability to update other elements within the selected focused area, as long as it is being applied to the parent of both the label and input.

Then, I found the next issue: The label that changes style only does so on focus state. Understandably so, but what happens when you remove the state? Of course it goes back to its default. The intention of the code practice is to make a label that floats up above the input when focused. If I cannot keep track of state without JavaScript, I'm not sure how this is going to work.

TODO: I suppose I could turn this practice into a React component that can manage the state and add/remove classes from the label. Right now, I'm leaving the code practice where I left it with the issue in place. Perhaps I can pick this up and implement my React solution in another practice.

### Update / Conclusion

So as is true with anything in development, there's a package for what I'm looking for: [float-label-css - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/float-label-css). This technique that I've been working on is known as the "Floating Labels" style of form elements. It appears this approach has been discussed before by many others and the package listed above is one such solution. I've also read that the order of label and input doesn't matter as much as I thought it did.
