## Code Practice

Today's code practice was building a calculator in React. The article outlined how to setup components to handle each of the button's actions as well as their display. In doing this practice, I see how I can implement existing modules such as mathjs to assist with various tasks in my React applications.

I took some liberties with this tutorial and updated the CSS to my own preferences. This was another great way for me to practice/re-enforce my knowledge of React application implementation. I was also able to setup my Dockerfile and docker-compose fairly quickly due to my practices from the previous days.
