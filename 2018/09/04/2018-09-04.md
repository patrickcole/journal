## Code Practice

Today I decided to complete the "React Autocomplete Example Tutorial" article for a code practice. I also managed to run through the JavaScript sort method article as well an introduction to the Resize Observer.

In regards to the React tutorial, this exercise was basically an implementation of the npm module, `react-autocomplete`. While it is good to see how to use this module/component, I feel the tutorial was somewhat misleading as we were not actually building an autocomplete component. I would be more interested in seeing how the implementation of the `<Autocomplete>` component works.

I was able to utilize the source code from the tutorial and tried to apply it to a more practical implementation such as a "stocks" section of a website or application.
