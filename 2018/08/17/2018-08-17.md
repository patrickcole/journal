## Code Practice

Started working on a SVG random polygon shape generator. The idea came from a [pen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/details/dNoMqx/) from Chris Coyier on randomizing shape points. I have started breaking down my path format and the boundaries I'm working with. Over time, I figured out that I don't need to keep track of each point inside an array. Rather, I can just keep randomizing each coordinate point on each iteration. The only "trick" is that I need to keep track of the origin point so that I can lineTo back to the origin to complete the shape.

Additionally, I like the idea of filling the shape with a pattern rather than a solid color or gradient. For this, I reviewed some SVG pattern libraries, repositories and generators. I found a great set from [iros on Github](http://iros.github.io/patternfills/) that matched my design. The patterns are encoded in base64 so in order to adjust them, I had to utilize some base64 decoding, make the adjustments, and then re-encode them back into base64.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the result of this code practice. I was able to break down each step and implement the entire shape generator in just under 2 hours of time. Looking forward, I want to look into how much of a performance hit does this cause on a low powered device. I also ask myself is the animation too distracting to users?
