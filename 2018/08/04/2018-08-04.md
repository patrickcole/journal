## Note

Today I spent a large portion of my afternoon working on some branding-related designs. I'm really hoping to start work on my blog so that I can get some writing out there for others to read. This journal continues to be a way for me to express what I'm reading, but I'd like to couple this with blog entries that reflect on what I have read in this journal. Since I spent a long time on designs, I did not read as much as I usually do.
