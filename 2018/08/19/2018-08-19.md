## Code Practice

From the article, "How to use ECMAScript modules to build modular components in JavaScript".

Today's code practice was centered on understanding how ECMAScript modules work and how to implement them. I've enjoyed using modules in Node, so to see them implemented in the browser now is excellent.

I decided to expand upon the example code found in the article I used. The author had two distinct examples of how to implement modular code with JavaScript. I decided to split each feature into its own .js file to keep things simple.

Ultimately, I'd like to feel more comfortable with this approach so that I can use it in my production code. I think with more time, practice and continued research; this will be the case.
