## Code Practices

Building the animated navigation component allowed me to quickly bootstrap a Vue project using a few CDNs. This was my first instance of using GreenSock's GSAP library as well. I'm now wondering if it's possible to create this *without* using GSAP. This might be a good exercise for me in the future.

*Update* to earlier text: I started to experiment with CSS transitions using cubic-bezier. What I realized was that CSS animations can be very limited in their transition timing implementation. The GSAP library really excels in that the developers have established multiple easing calculations that represent very well the expected easing results.

I was able to figure out a bezier-cubic value that was sufficiently close to the GSAP equivalent. I duplicated the example from the code practice and built a CSS version (still using Vue) that just about runs the same as the GSAP version. I am very pleased with what I was able to figure out in a short amount of time.
