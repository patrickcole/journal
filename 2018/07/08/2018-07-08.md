## Code Practice

Overall, this code practice was a great way for me to get back into using Webpack and Vue. It had been a couple of months since I had used Webpack and I just don't have the process nailed down yet. The author of these articles did a great job explaining why certain configurations were needed in both client and server. I noticed one issue in the article and notified the author through the comments. Hopefully, others will see the corrected issue and won't run into the troubles I had.

This practice will probably be a good starting configuration for any future Vue work I will be doing.
