## Code Practices

- css-animation.html
  - A basic starter on performant animation with CSS. Some excellent examples for getting going the right way and not relying on libraries such as jQuery.
- color-game.html
  - I had fun with this code example! The idea came from the "Learn how to manipulate the DOM by building a simple JavaScript color game" article. The author was trying to get their point across on things like using the DOM to alter content. While that content was great, I found some things I didn't like about how the author was doing their code. I eventually decided to take this concept and run with it. I decided to make the "game" more dynamic by always building the color buttons on each new restart. This gave the program more flexibility so that when the user switches between easy and hard, it doesn't have to hide/show certain pre-built elements.

  I have also looked into performance with this as any event listeners are immediately removed upon reset. This ensures that no listeners are still active on elements that no longer appear. Other items such as using `<button>` elements to properly show focus were additions that I made for limited motion accessibility.
